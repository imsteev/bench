# What is this
A web application skeleton, tuned to my preferences. My hope is that it is
helpful to others.

Stack: Bun on the server-side serving HTMX to clients

### Run it
For development, I've found it useful to alias a hot-reloading Bun program
```
alias hot='bun --hot index.ts'  # replace `index.ts` with your usual entrypoint
```

Then
```
hot
```
