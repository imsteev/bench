# What is this
A web application skeleton with sensible defaults.
Bun on the server-side, serving HTMX to clients.

### Run it
For development, I've found it useful to alias a hot-reloading Bun program
```
alias hot='bun --hot index.ts'  # replace `index.ts` with your usual entrypoint
```
Then:
```
hot
```
